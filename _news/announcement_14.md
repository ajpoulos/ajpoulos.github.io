I gave two presentations at the [18th World Conference on Erthquake Engineering](https://www.wcee2024.it/){:target="_blank"}: (1) [Influence of faulting style on the directionality of earthquake response spectra](/assets/pdf/Poulos_2024_b_WCEE.pdf){:target="_blank"} and (2) [Accounting for ground motion directionality in regional seismic risk assessment](/assets/pdf/Poulos_2024_a_WCEE.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
