I am a PhD candidate at Stanford. Most of my research is within the field of earthquake engineering. Some of my specific topics of interest are the characterization of earthquake ground motion and the assessment of seismic risk of spatially distributed infrastructure.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Civil Engineering and an MSc in Structural Engineering at [Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/en){:target="_blank"}. I then worked at the Research Center for Integrated Disaster Risk Management ([Cigiden](https://www.cigiden.cl/en/home/){:target="_blank"}) in Chile. I also have industry and consulting experience in seismic hazard and risk assessment.

This website presents my [publications](/publications) and keeps track of my research progress. I also plan to summarize some of my research projects and share source codes in the future.
