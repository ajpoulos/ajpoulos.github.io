I am a second-year PhD student at Stanford. Most of my research is within the fields of earthquake engineering and engineering seismology. Some of my specific topics of interest are the characterization of earthquake ground motion and the assessment of seismic risk of spatially distributed infrastructure.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Civil Engineering and an MSc in Structural Engineering at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile (2014). I then worked at the Research Center for Integrated Disaster Risk Management in Santiago, Chile. I also have industry and consulting experience in seismic hazard and risk assessment.
