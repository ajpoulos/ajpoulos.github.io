I am a Civil Engineer working at the [Earthquake Science Center](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/earthquake-science-center){:target="_blank"} of the US Geological Survey. Most of my research is within the field of earthquake engineering. Some of my specific topics of interest are the characterization and simulation of earthquake ground motion and the assessment of seismic risk of spatially distributed infrastructure.

I hold a PhD in Structural Engineering from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I also completed my undergraduate studies in Civil Engineering and an MSc in Structural Engineering at [Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/en){:target="_blank"}. I previously worked at the Research Center for Integrated Disaster Risk Management ([Cigiden](https://www.cigiden.cl/en/home/){:target="_blank"}) in Chile. I also have industry and consulting experience in seismic hazard and risk assessment.

This website presents my [publications](/publications) and keeps track of my research progress. It also summarizes the [research topics](/research) I have worked on.
